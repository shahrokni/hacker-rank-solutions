# Hacker Rank Solutions

From zero to hero: Solving HackerRank algorithm challenges using the C programming language

**_This project was created under the Dick Dastardly Project_**

# Project Dick Dastardly

The so-called **Project Dick Dastardly** is a computer science self-improvement plan that covers a set of old-fashioned topics, often neglected by many developers nowadays. The topics include:

- C/C++ and x86 Assembly language
- A deep understanding of the Linux OS
- A deep understanding of computer architecture
- Data structure implementation with the C programming language
- Solving algorithmic challenges with the C programming language

**_Project Dick Dastardly may evolve over time and expand to include additional topics_**
